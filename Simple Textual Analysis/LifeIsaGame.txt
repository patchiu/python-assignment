Life Is A Game - Poem by shraddha shraddha the poetess
Whenever you feel alone or you feel sad
do something which makes you feel glad
it's fine if you find situations not so good,,
but don't think them bad..
anything could happen to anyone in this life
as life is a game....
someone get exploited, otherone get fame
this is not compulsary that all the situations be always same
someone get a huge loss, anyone else get gain...
sorrow and happiness both are stations,
of life named mooving train! ! !
if you now this fact then no more pain...
as life is a game! ! !
