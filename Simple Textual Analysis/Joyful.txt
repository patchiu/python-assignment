Joyful - Brenton Brown
Joyful joyful we adore You
God of glory, Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flowers before You
Opening to the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away
Giver of Eternal gladness
Fill us with the light of day
You are the One who saves
You are the One who saves
You are the One who's hands lift us from the grave
You are the light of life
The everlasting day
You are the One who takes all our sins away
